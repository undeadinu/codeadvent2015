        <p>Hi there! This will be a series of blog posts exploring image processing with browser and HTML5 <code>canvas</code> element. Before we start dive into filers and effects, let's start by looking at how image data is handled on canvas.</p>
<h2>Loading an image to browser</h2>
<p>As web engineer, we take it for granted <code>&lt;img src=&quot;image.jpg&quot;&gt;</code> displays an image in a browser because it is a &quot;digital photo&quot;. But how does the image look like when you are dealing with image with JavaScript?</p>
<h3>Use Image contractor to create image element</h3>
<p>The way to create <code>HTMLImageElement</code> (without writing HTML tag) is to use a Image constructor. You can create new Image instance, then add <code>src</code> attribute to the instance much like you type <code>&lt;img src=&quot;image.jpg&quot;&gt;</code>. At this point, <code>img</code> object you created has same properties as HTMLImageElement, in the sample you can see width and height properties are console logged.</p>

<h2>Draw on canvas</h2>
<p>Let's try to get not only properties but also the actual data of this image. Canvas element in HTML5 has nifty method <code>getImageData</code> which provides pixel by pixel information about an image.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating Canvas element. There is no constructor like we used for Image, so we'll have to do <code>document.createElement('canvas')</code> much like you create other HTML element in JavaScript.</p>
<p>So let's draw an image into this newly created canvas element. It may feel natural to call method on the element itself like <code>canvas.drawImage()</code>...however, in canvas element rendering layer - a layer that handles drawing on browser - is provided as separate thing called <code>context</code>.</p>
<h3>what is &quot;context&quot; ?</h3>
<p>Context is a layer that handles &quot;what is drawn on where&quot;. You can specify how you want to send drawing instruction (called <code>contextType</code>). In this post, we are going to use '2d' context type - which let us specify x and y position of an object we want to draw. Other context type is <code>webgl</code> which is used to draw 3D object.
You can get 2d context by calling <code>getContext('2d')</code> on canvas element.</p>
<h3>drawImage and getImageData</h3>
<p>Now we are ready to draw our image into canvas using our 2d context.
Since we have Image object, we can use <code>drawImage()</code> method on 2d context to draw image on our canvas element.
Once the image is in canvas, we can call <code>getImageData()</code> on 2d context to see data underneath the canvas.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example, context returned <code>ImageData</code> object which contains width, height, and data of the canvas. We'll use this data for our image processing expiration from now on.</p>
