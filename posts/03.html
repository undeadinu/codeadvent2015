        <p>Why does Canvas use Typed Array to handle data? Why can't we use regular Array? Let's look into Typed Array - what it is and when to use them.</p>
<h2>Regular Array - an oven sheet</h2>
<p><em>It can hold various shapes and sizes.</em></p>
<p>Regular JavaScript Array is very versatile. It can holed mix of data types and can be expanded or shortened as you go.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var array = [];
array[0] = 1;
array.push(2);
array[2] = {};
array.push('string')
// array now looks like : [1,2,{},'string']
</code></pre>

<p>It is like an oven sheet in your home, you can bake various sizes of cinnamon buns, or cook Turkey and Brussels Sprouts at the same time for holiday dinner. While versatility is useful, it means regular JavaScript Array has to account for many possible occasion and is not so great at performance.</p>
<h2>Typed Array - a muffin pan</h2>
<p><em>Optimized for specific shape and size.</em></p>
<p>Typed Arrays are array-like objects that is designed to only handle raw binary data. There are 9 different types depending on size of each element (how many bytes it holds) and how binary data is handled.
As this is different from regular Array, not all methods in regular Array are available for Typed Arrays (i.e. <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>). Also calling <code>Array.isArray()</code> with Typed Array returns false.</p>
<pre><code>var typedArray = new Int8Array(2); //creates an array pre-filled with 0
typedArray[0] = 240;
typedArray[1] = 'string'; // will remain 0 since string is not binary
console.log(typedArray)   // [240, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>You can think of Typed Arrays as different baking molds at professional bakery. Weather its Muffin or Madeleine, those molds are designed to handle same amount of batter for same shape of baked goods. There are no flexibility to cook Turkey, but it is very efficient at making lots and lots of same shaped goods.</p>
<h3>Anatomy of Typed Arrays</h3>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4581495/11565977/74623808-99ae-11e5-9d2e-ec444f6cada1.png" width="80%"></p>
<pre><code>Int8Array         // 8-bit two's complement signed integer
Uint8Array        // 8-bit unsigned integer
Uint8ClampedArray // 8-bit unsigned integer (clamped)
Int16Array        // 16-bit two's complement signed integer
Uint16Array       // 16-bit unsigned integer
Int32Array        // 32-bit two's complement signed integer
Uint32Array       // 32-bit unsigned integer
Float32Array      // 32-bit IEEE floating point number
Float64Array      // 8 64-bit IEEE floating point number
</code></pre>
<h3>Overflow and &quot;Clamped&quot;</h3>
<p>What if we assign a value larger than it can handle? In other words, what happens if we put too much batter in each muffin tin?</p>
<p>Most Typed Arrays take care of this situation by only talking overflow. If you try to assign 280 into an <code>Unit8Array</code> (limited to 0 - 255), it will only keep 24 (280 - 256 = 24).</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var typedArray = new Uint8Array(1);
typedArray[0] = 280;
console.log(typedArray)   // [24]
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;Clamped&quot; Typed Array, on the other hand, takes care of this by taking value closest to it's size. Let's think about the sample in previous post which we increased color of red by 30.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, width, height).data;
for(var i=0; i&lt;imageData.length; i+=4){
  imageData[i] += 30
}
</code></pre>
<p>If the original color already had value of 255, and then we added 30, it will try to assign 285 to ImageData object which use <code>Uint8ClampedArray</code>, thus size of red is kept to max value of 255.</p>
<p>If it was using non-clamped array like <code>Unit8Array</code>, it will only take overflow of 29 which turns color darker instead of brightening it. In color value, lowest is always 0 and highest is always 255, in other words a pixel can only be brightened to 255 and darkened to 0. Clamped Array is designed to take care of these situation easily by always choosing closest value to it's size when overflow happens.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var typedArray = new Uint8ClampedArray(3);
typedArray[0] = 280;
typedArray[0] = 230;
typedArray[0] = -30;
console.log(typedArray)   // [255, 230, 0]
</code></pre>
<p>Now we know more about data that consists image. Let's start applying image processing technique in next post.</p>
